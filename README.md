||Project Name: Cosmos Wallet||

#Description

A web-based wallet application for managing Ethereum and Solana accounts. Cosmos Wallet provides a user-friendly interface for generating new wallets, viewing wallet information, and securely storing private keys.

#Features

Wallet Generation:
Generates secure seed phrases for both Ethereum and Solana wallets.
Allows users to copy the seed phrase to their clipboard.
Wallet Management:
Displays information about each created wallet (wallet number, public key).
Enables users to delete wallets they no longer need.
Privacy:
Private keys are initially hidden for security reasons.
Users can reveal private keys by clicking a button, with the option to copy them to the clipboard.
Visual Appeal:
Utilizes a background video for a dynamic and engaging user experience.
Responsiveness:
Designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices (consider implementing a responsive design library for optimal performance).
#Installation

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/cosmos-wallet.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd cosmos-wallet
Install dependencies: npm install
#Usage

Start the development server: npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in package.json) in your browser.
#Dependencies

react: The core React library for building user interfaces.
react-dom: Renders React components in the browser. (Included with react)
bip39: Generates secure seed phrases (for Ethereum).
@solana/web3.js: Interacts with the Solana blockchain (for Solana).
bs58: Encodes and decodes base58 strings (for Solana private key handling).
(Optional) A responsive design library (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS) to enhance user experience across devices.
#Development

The source code for the React components is located in the src directory. Feel free to modify or extend the components according to your requirements. To make changes:

Edit the relevant component files (e.g., MainPage.js, SeedPhrase.js, CustomCard.js, SolanaComponent.js).
Save your changes.
The development server will automatically recompile and refresh the browser, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.
Testing

While this example doesn't include specific test files, consider implementing a testing framework like Jest to ensure the functionality of your components. This will help you maintain a high level of code quality and catch potential issues early on.
